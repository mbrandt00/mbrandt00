# My Mod 0 Plan

## Strategies 
### 1. Read ahead before starting work. 
 - Read lesson plans. 
  - Read homeworks day before starting to allow for **diffuse mode** learning. 
  > Diffuse mode is associated with *“big picture”* perspectives, and happens when you relax and let your mind wander. If you are trying to understand or figure out something new, turn off your focused thinking and turn on your diffuse mode. Try to toggle back and forth between modes, especially if you find yourself stuck. ~A Mind for Numbers
  
### 2. Review! 
 - Review homework comments from instructors. 
 - Review lesson plans after lecture.
 - Study strategies gleaned from readings. 

### 3. Apply!
1. Learn new skills. 
2. Apply new skills. 
3. Success!

### 4. Remember that Success is non-linear and embrace failure!

### 5.  I will also create beautiful code snippers in my notes, following proper convention during my backend program as below. 
 ```ruby
puts "This is a code block in ruby!"
 ```
- I will also explain what I did to make it clear to everyone. 
  - This above code snippet uses the ruby `puts` command. `puts` simply prints text.
